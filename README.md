# Anagram-Generator
A small program I made fresh out of college so I'd have something to display here.

Run it with the standard javac and java commands to get it running, provide it as many words or phrases as you want, and then type "x" to exit. It only accepts characters found in the English alphabet and spaces.

Only begins to run poorly when you give it something using too many unqiue letters of the alphabet, which I'm trying to think of how to fix.
